              <h1>Who am I?</h1>
              <p>My name is robin schellingerhout. I am born in 1999 and live in a small town called nieuwe vennep. I am in my third year on the school Media Collage Amsterdam of the education game development. Here I learn many different program languages so when I am going to work somewhere I am not restricted to one language. At my lats job I was greengrocer at the local supermarket. Here I learned to work independently but also work as a team.</p>

              <h1>Hobbies</h1>

              <h1>Why game development?</h1>
              <p>I have always wanted a job where I can be creative. A job where people can enjoy what you made. And since I like games myself as well. So I thought I am going to give game development a shot. Even though it can be hard, I really like it. I think gaming is a good way to distract people from real life. So I want to help with that.</p>
